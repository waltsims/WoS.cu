abstract = "This investigation presents an analysis of a Monte Carlo method for estimating local solutions to the Dirichlet problem for Poisson's equation. The probabilistic algorithm consists of a modified “walk on spheres” that includes the effects from internal sources as part of the random process. A new derivation of the asymptotic expressions for the rate of convergence and average runtime of the algorithm is presented. These estimates are used to compare the Monte Carlo method with discrete difference schemes. Numerical experiments involving some two-dimensional problems confirm the efficiency of the probabilistic scheme. "

abstract="We show that a constant-potential time-independent Schr{\"o}dinger equation with Dirichlet boundary data can be reformulated as a Laplace equation with Dirichlet boundary data. With this reformulation, which we call the Duffin correspondence, we provide a classical Walk On Spheres (WOS) algorithm for Monte Carlo simulation of the solutions of the boundary value problem. We compare the obtained Duffin WOS algorithm with existing modified WOS algorithms.",

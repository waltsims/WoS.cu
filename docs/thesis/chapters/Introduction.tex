Harmonic \Gls{PDE} exhibit many interesting properties, that
have long the been the subject of research.  Many of theses properties are well
understood \cite{Axler1992,Sheldon}.  Although there are methods to solve such
\Glspl{PDE} on a grid \cite{Bornemann}, discrete Monte Carlo Solvers, have been shown
to be more efficient \cite{Bornemann, DeLaurentis, kakutani1944}, when only a
singular value in the domain is of interest, or in higher dimensions. They can also
be more reliable when severe gradients are present,
when finite-differences normally would fail \cite{DeLaurentis}. One example of such a case are
 turbulent fluid simulations, where the boundary behavior of a turbulent
fluid is still being researched.  These Monte Carlo Methods, which solve problems
through random inputs into a system, and the evaluation of the subsequent result,
have long been a mathematical oddity, and field of great interest, but have yet
to overtake more conventional solvers such as the finite differences and multi-grid method
methods.
\par
A major benefit of Monte Carlo methods, is their propensity for parallelism.  Often,
the the execution of individual random inputs into a system  and their subsequent evaluation
are independent
, and can therefore be executed in parallel.

The current trend towards parallel computing has brought with it many new and exciting
technologies.  Along with multi-core processors, \Glspl{GPU} have moved on from
their humble beginings as graphical co-processors.  Thanks to their execution
stragetie and computationa architechture, \Glspl{GPU} are being used by many for
high dimensional parrallel tasks. Since so have already
claimed that \Gls{RWoS} can and should be implemented in a highly parallel manner,
( \cite{DeLaurentis,Sabelfeld}, etc.), especially in high dimensions,  It is the goal
 of this work to follow through on these claims.  Given the
current trend toward parallel computing, this work strives to implement
\Gls{RWoS}, a Monte-Carlo Solver for harmonic \Glspl{PDE} on one of the most modern
parallel architectures, and trends in parallel computing, the \Gls{GPU}.

%what this work will strive to do and what will be shown.


%practical analogy of how head dispersion from a point in a material or nuclear
%fusion also take a random path from a point and defuse randomly.
%physical analogy of the algorithm. integration of all paths could represent a single
% state at one time point.

% second analogy would be not being able to put sensors inside a system and want
%want to extrapolated data from boundary sensors

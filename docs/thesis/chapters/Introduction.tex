%everyone says the the alogrithms can be implimented in a highly parallel manner,
% Delaurentis and Sabelfeld etc. especially for higher dimensions

% random walk on spheres can conquer high gradients where finite differences would normally fail.

%cite other practical work Dlaurentis and Romero

%practical analogy of how head dispersion from a point in a material or nuclear
%fusion also take a random path from a point and defuse randomly.
%physical analogy of the algorithm. integration of all paths could represent a single
% state at one time point.

% second analogy would be not being able to put sensors inside a system and want
%want to extrapolated data from boundary sensors

The task of solving high dimensional partial differential equations numerically
can be challenging and time consuming.  Nevertheless, the solutions of these problems
can be of the utmost importance, for instance in the fields of nuclear fusion and modern finance.
In order to solve these math problems, we need highly powerful and parallel computers
to assist us. As computing resources become more powerful, programming highly
parallel computing systems becomes more complex.  We intend to show that high
dimensional PDEs can be efficiently solved running the Random Walk on Spheres algorithm
on Graphical Processing Units (GPU).  To do this, we built a proof of concept
to solve a classic exemplary PDE, compared running time on the GPU to CPU running time
and calculated the performance gains.  In this work, we we had great success proving the
efficacy of this approach and  measured performance gains of 600 times for 128 dimensional
case.  Even higher performance gains are expected in higher dimensions. This work
strives to show the applicability of Random Walk on Spheres in solving high dimensional Partial
Differential Equations, and serve as a guideline for future work in order to
attain highly optimized solvers.
